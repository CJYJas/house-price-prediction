# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project uses **machine learning** to predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, etc.  
It is built as part of my learning journey in **AI/ML** and demonstrates end-to-end workflow: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (encoding, scaling)  
- Regression models using **scikit-learn**  
- Model evaluation with metrics (RMSE)  
- Implemented in **Google Colab**
